"""
This module interfaces with Discord to create:
1) A set of cosmetic roles in the bot's server based on the course list given,
2) Empty private channels for the corresponding subject roles, and
3) A message that we can copy-paste as the rolemenu message.
This bot is only intended to work as a complement of other rolemenu creation bots like Carl bot, by automating the part
of the process where we create the channel, while allowing the other bot to handle the menu operations by itself.
